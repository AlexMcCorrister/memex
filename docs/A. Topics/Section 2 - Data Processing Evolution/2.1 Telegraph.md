The telegraph has a complicated and rocky start. Many individuals have taken credit for the development of the telegraph. Alexander Graham Bell. Thomas Edison. Guglielmo Marconi. These are just a few of the individuals who have taken credit, and have been given credit, for the invention, however one common attribute between them all, is that it all took place in the late 1800s. While Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison were too of the more famous individuals here in North America, Marconi had major successes in Italy and Europe. Marconi was the first to patent a system for wireless telegraphy at only the age of 22 and he successfully established the first wireless communication connects between Great Britain and France.  In 1902, he was able to establish the first transatlantic communications link between Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and Poldhu, Cornwall in Great Britain. This led to further developments and an eventual permanent communication between Europe and North American, which came in use during the First World War.
