## Thoughts

While Bell and Edison were both developing their own forms of telegraph, in the end Bell was known for his contributions to the telegraph while Edison was mostly known for his contributions to the light bulb and frankly Bell outpaced Edison in the long run. Bell found two the largest telecommunication companies in North America. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada, now Bell Canada, and American Bell, which later became AT&T. While initially the two companies were both owned and operated by Alexander Graham Bell, under Bell Systems, where they would construct the largest telephone network in the world, they would eventually separate follow the initial collapse of AT&T in which they had to relinquish control of regions of the United States and Canada as they had become a monopoly.
